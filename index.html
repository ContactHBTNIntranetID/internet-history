                                            <h1 style="color: white;">1.2 History of the Internet</h1>
                                            <p id="colp">The internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location.
                                                 The internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investments and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology.
                                                  Today, terms like bleiner@computer.org and https://www.acm.org trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street.
                                                The history of the internet revolves around four distinct aspects.
                                                 There is the technological evolution that began on early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance and higher-level functionality.
                                                  There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community of internauts working together to create, and evolve the technology. And there is commercialization aspect, resulting in an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available information infrastructure.
                                                The internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) information infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects – technological, organizational and community.

                    <h1>1.3 WWW VS THE INTERNET</h1>
                    <p>The Web and the internet are closely related but distinct concepts. The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicates using various protocols. It includes emails, file transfer and other forms of data exchange.
                        On the other hand, the Web is a system of interconnected documents and resources, accessed through the internet. It’s a subset of the internet that allows users to view and interact with web pages, navigate through hyperlinks, and access multimedia content. In simpler terms, the internet is the infrastructure that enables various services, while the World Wide Web is one of the most prominent services running on that infrastructure.
                        Internet:
                        The Internet is a vast global network of interconnected computer networks. It's a network of networks, connecting millions of computers, servers, devices, and data centres around the world. The Internet enables communication and data transfer among these connected devices using various protocols, including TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
                        
                        The Internet existed before the World Wide Web and encompasses a wide range of services and technologies beyond just web browsing. It includes email, instant messaging, online gaming, file sharing, remote access, and more. 
                        World Wide Web (WWW):
                        The World Wide Web, often referred to as the "Web," is a specific subset of services and content available on the Internet. It's a system of interlinked hypertext documents and multimedia content that can be accessed via the Internet. The Web is built on top of the Internet's infrastructure and relies on technologies such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to display and link content.
                        
                        When you use a web browser to access websites, read articles, watch videos, and interact with web-based applications, you're using the World Wide Web. Websites are hosted on servers connected to the Internet, and you access them by typing in URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) or clicking on links.
                        
                        In summary, the Internet is the underlying global network that enables the connectivity of devices and the exchange of data, while the World Wide Web is a subset of services on the Internet that allows users to access and interact with multimedia content and information through web browsers. The Web is just one of many services that the Internet facilitates.
